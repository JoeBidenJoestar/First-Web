        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I was born in Jakarta, 2005. I study and live in Bekasi for 12 years before I move to Surabaya to pursue my degree in Informatics at ITS.
            I am a student who loves to learn and explore new things. This is my first time to create a website, so I hope you can bear with me.

        <h3>1. Night Riding</h3>
        <p>I love night riding around Surabaya, usually I go around 00.00 AM and go home by 03.45 AM. It's a great way to relieve stress and enjoy the city at night. The vibes just feel different
            compared to daylight.  I love the feeling of freedom and the rush of adrenaline when I'm riding at night, no traffic, the road feels like
            its yours.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Playing Games</h3>
        <p>I love playing games, especially games that are free and does not require much grinding, skills, and are not competitive. Currently my 
            favorite game is Zenless Zone Zero, replacing the previous favorite game, War Thunder, which requires a lot of grinding.
            I don't play Valorant, PUBG, or any other competitive FPS games. Worth mentioning I still play games on Roblox, GTA V, Mafia, and Wuthering Waves.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Music</h3>
        <p>I love listening to musics, but not all genre. My favorite genres are post-punk and synthwave. The music I am listening to
            depends on my mood. My favorite band for post-punk genre would be Molchat Doma (although I don't understand their lyrics since
            they are written in Russian). I usually listen to synthwave during night riding, giving me "Literally Me" ahh vibes.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Anime</h3>
        <p>This hobby is quite short-lived, only around 1.5 years, and on top of that I was quite picky. I don't like fantasy genre
            (exceptions for JJBA, they are gold) or isekai stuff. I don't like anime that is depressing or traumatizing (my live is depressing enough)
            or anime that is too long, have too much filler episode.
